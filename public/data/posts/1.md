# Hello, World!

Hi there, I’m Mohammad Asad Atterkhan, and welcome to my very first post!

## A Bit of My Story <a id="a-bit-of-my-story"></a>

Ever since I can remember, I’ve been fascinated by the way things work. Growing up, I spent countless hours tinkering with gadgets and computers—always curious about the magic behind the screens. That curiosity led me to study Computer Science & Systems Engineering for my undergraduate degree—a journey filled with late nights debugging code, troubleshooting network issues, and celebrating small victories when things finally clicked into place.

I had the opportunity to step into the industry a bit early, at 20 in 2023, while still in my first year of university, starting as a Software Trainee at [GammaTech Ltd](https://www.gammatech.com). This was my first official job. Prior to that, I worked with my dad at his company, [Textile Sewing Services Ltd](https://textilesewingservices.com).

Then in 2024, I transitioned from the trainee phase to a professional role, landing a job as an IT Support Engineer at Tropic Knits Group of [CIEL Textile](https://www.cieltextile.com). This experience has been equally challenging and rewarding—every day brings a new problem to solve, and with each challenge, I learn something valuable. It’s this blend of technical challenge and constant learning that keeps my passion for technology alive.

## Beyond the Code <a id="beyond-the-code"></a>

But there’s more to me than just lines of code and tech projects. I’m a creative problem-solver who loves exploring innovative ideas—whether it’s diving into the latest tech trends, building DIY projects with my Raspberry Pi, learning a new topic, or simply taking a break to play with my favorite furry friend (yes, I’m a proud cat lover!). These little moments remind me that there’s always room for fun, even in a busy, tech-driven life.

## What to Expect Here <a id="what-to-expect-here"></a>

This blog isn’t just a digital resume; it’s a space where I’ll document my experiences, share insights, and talk about the hurdles and triumphs along the way. I’m excited to start this journey with posts that might cover:
- Behind-the-scenes looks at my development process
- Lessons learned from real-world projects
- Tips, tricks, and resources that I find useful
- My evolving thoughts on the tech industry

I especially hope to dedicate a section to teaching Computer Science for O and A level students.

## Let’s Connect! <a id="lets-connect"></a>

I’m always open to feedback, ideas, or even a friendly chat about the latest in tech. Feel free to drop a comment or connect with me on LinkedIn. Your insights and suggestions will help this blog grow into a community of curious minds.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you’ll join me on this exciting journey of discovery and innovation!

Cheers,
